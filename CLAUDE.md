# CLAUDE.md — Crux Platform Context

Read this first. This is the full context for continuing work on the Crux gym management SaaS.

---

## What Is Crux?

Crux is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** for climbing and bouldering gyms. Gyms pay a monthly subscription to access the platform. Each gym gets their own isolated subdomain (`gymname.cruxgym.co.uk`) and a completely separate SQLite database. There is no shared data between gyms.

**Business model:** Oscar (the platform owner) sells subscriptions to gym owners. Starter £59/mo, Growth £99/mo, Scale £149/mo. 14-day free trial on signup.

**Target market:** UK climbing and bouldering gyms, specifically independent operators who can't afford or don't need bloated enterprise software.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (one DB per gym + one platform DB)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS SPA (no framework), Tailwind CSS via CDN
- **Auth:** JWT for staff sessions, PIN-based login for staff at the desk
- **Email:** Nodemailer via Gmail SMTP (`cruxgymhq@gmail.com`)
- **Payments (member-facing):** GoCardless (direct debit) + Dojo (in-person card) — placeholders/partial
- **Payments (platform billing):** Stripe — live with real API keys, checkout + webhook handler active
- **Hosting:** AWS EC2 (eu-west-1), served via nginx

## How to Run

```bash
cd /home/ec2-user/.openclaw/workspace/boulderryn-project

# Development (single gym, no subdomain routing)
DEFAULT_GYM_ID=mygym PORT=8080 node server.js

# With admin panel enabled and a specific token
DEFAULT_GYM_ID=mygym PORT=8080 ADMIN_TOKEN=mysecrettoken node server.js

# Provision a new gym
node scripts/provision-gym.js mygym "My Gym Name"
```

**Admin panel:** Visit `/admin` → login with `ADMIN_TOKEN` value.

## Self-Serve Signup & Auth — How It Works

This feature is now built. Here's how the flow works:

### Domain structure
- `cruxgym.co.uk` — marketing site + "Sign Up" / "Log In" links
- `cruxgym.co.uk/signup` — signup page (backend route + HTML)
- `cruxgym.co.uk/login` — login page for returning users
- `gymname.cruxgym.co.uk` — individual gym instance

### Signup flow (`/signup`)
Multi-step:
1. **Personal details** — name, email, password (gym owner account)
2. **Gym details** — gym name, subdomain (auto-generated from gym name)
3. **Stripe** — card details, 14-day trial (redirects to Stripe Checkout)
4. On completion: gym provisioned, owner account created, welcome email sent, redirect to subdomain with welcome modal

### Login flow (`/login`)
- Email + password
- Redirect to gymname.cruxgym.co.uk on success

### Staff accounts
- All staff get email accounts
- Invite flow: owner enters email in Settings → Staff → invite email sent → staff sets password via link
- **Desk login:** PIN only (quick actions, each staff has unique PIN for audit)
- **Web/remote login:** email + password

### Role-based permissions
**Full access** (Owner, Tech Lead, Duty Manager): everything
**Desk-only** (Centre Assistant, Route Setter): Visitors, Members, POS, Events (view only), Routes (Route Setter only)
**Restricted:** Analytics, Settings, Billing, Staff management (admin/manager only)

Sidebar only shows permitted nav items based on role.

## What Still Needs Doing

### 1. Reset test on existing gyms
Existing gyms provisioned before the setup wizard won't have `setup_complete` set. To trigger the wizard on an existing gym:
```bash
sqlite3 data/gyms/{gym_id}/gym.db "UPDATE settings SET value='0' WHERE key='setup_complete';"
```

### 2. Resetting for local dev/testing
```bash
sqlite3 data/gyms/mygym/gym.db "DELETE FROM staff; UPDATE settings SET value='0' WHERE key='setup_complete';"
DEFAULT_GYM_ID=mygym PORT=8080 node server.js
```

### 3. Potential future features
- Member-facing app (`app.html`) — logbook, booking, profile
- GoCardless direct debit integration (member-facing recurring payments)
- Push notifications / email reminders for expiring passes
- Multi-location support (one gym, multiple sites)
- Bulk member import (CSV upload)

---

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

- `server.js` has a UNIQUE constraint error on first startup sometimes — related to waiver template seeding. Usually harmless.
- The `requireBilling` middleware treats missing billing records as "trialing + active" — correct for now.
- Staff PIN login uses a simple hash — fine for now, consider bcrypt for production.
- The `boulderryn-project` folder and GitHub repo should be renamed to `crux` or `cruxgym`.
- YouTube embeds use `youtube-nocookie.com` with `referrerpolicy="origin"` — works on live domain, may have issues on localhost with some ad blockers.

---

## Member Portal — Spec (NOT YET BUILT — next major feature)

A member-facing web app / PWA. Members access it at `gymname.cruxgym.co.uk/me`.

### Auth
- Members register via the waiver form (captures their email + creates their account)
- Login: enter email → confirmation code sent → logged in (no password, OTP/magic link style)
- Session persisted in localStorage so they stay logged in on their device
- Members save the link or access it from welcome email
- Future: native app (iOS/Android) — for now PWA only

### What members see

**1. QR Code**
- Their unique entry QR code shown prominently on the home screen
- Tap to go fullscreen (for easy scanning at the desk)
- Shows pass type + expiry date below

**2. Gym Map + Routes**
- The gym's floor plan map (same data as staff gym map builder)
- Zoomable and pannable
- Each route is a marker/pin on the map
- Tap a route → see grade, colour, setter name, date set
- "Mark as sent" button — saves to their personal logbook (stored per member in DB)
- Routes section = member logbook (their sends history)

**3. Noticeboard**
- List of announcements from the gym, newest first
- Only managers/owners can post (from within the staff app)
- Each post has title, body, optional image, date
- Members see new posts highlighted / badge on noticeboard tab

### PWA
- Installable to phone home screen (no App Store)
- `manifest.json` already exists in `/src/public/` — extend it
- Add a service worker for basic offline support (cache the map + last-seen noticeboard)
- Theme colour: gym's brand colour (or Crux navy `#1E3A5F` as fallback)

### Backend routes needed
- `POST /me/auth/request` — send OTP to email
- `POST /me/auth/verify` — verify OTP, return session token
- `GET /me/profile` — member profile, pass status, QR code data
- `GET /me/map` — gym map + routes (same as staff map, read-only)
- `POST /me/routes/:id/send` — mark route as sent
- `DELETE /me/routes/:id/send` — unmark
- `GET /me/logbook` — member's sends history
- `GET /me/noticeboard` — list of posts
- `POST /api/noticeboard` — create post (managers only, requires auth + role check)
- `DELETE /api/noticeboard/:id` — delete post (managers only)

### DB changes needed
- `member_sends` table: `member_id`, `route_id`, `sent_at`
- `noticeboard` table: `id`, `gym_id`, `title`, `body`, `image_url`, `created_by`, `created_at`
- `member_sessions` table (or use JWT): for OTP auth tokens

## Marketing Website

Separate from the app. Lives at `/home/ec2-user/.openclaw/workspace/crux-website/` and is served by nginx from `/var/www/cruxgym/`.

- 4 pages: index.html, features.html, pricing.html, contact.html
- Contact form handler: `crux-website/form-handler.js` running as systemd service `crux-form-handler` on port 3001
- Emails go to `cruxgymhq@gmail.com` (hello@cruxgym.co.uk forward)
